## Product Technology

This product loosely follows traditional MVC (Model View Controller) paradigms where:
   - The Model = the PostgreSQL database - is handled in the `/pgdb` directory
   - The View = the React user interface - is handled in the `/ui` directory
   - The Controller = the Node restful api  - handled in the `/api` directory
